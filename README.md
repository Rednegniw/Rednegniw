# Hi there, I'm Antonín! 👋

### 👨‍💻 Full Stack Web & Native Developer

I am a professional web developer with 9+ years of experience building everything from massive enterprise systems to utility native apps.

I love solving complex engineering problems and creating beautiful UIs, be it for large SaaS apps like my startup Bill Systems or for my caffeine tracking app, Caffeine Clock. Particularly lately I love to work with animations.
