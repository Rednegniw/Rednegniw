**Hi there, I'm Antonín.** 👋

I am a professional web developer with 9+ years of experience building everything from massive enterprise systems to utility native apps. I love solving complex engineering problems and creating beautiful UIs, be it for large SaaS apps like my startup Bill Systems or for my caffeine tracking app, Caffeine Clock. Lately, I love to work with animations and open source libraries.

Currently, in my spare time I'm working on:
* Alcohol-tracking app based on Caffeine Clock
* an open-source library called [number-flow-react-native](https://github.com/Rednegniw/number-flow-react-native).

**I'm open to work!** Either in Prague or remote via a contract. Let me know about any interesting opportunities at [antonin.wingender@gmail.com](mailto:antonin.wingender@gmail.com).
